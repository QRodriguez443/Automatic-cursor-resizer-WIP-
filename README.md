# SWTOR Launch Automizer

A fun little idea to speed up the login process for the SWTOR MMO and change the cursor size automatically, 
as the in-game cursor is much smaller and hard to see (On higher resolutions).

## Requirements

Python 3.12
pip v. 24.0

## Installation

Run the following using command prompt: pip install -r requirements.txt

Ensure to open the environment file and follow instructions for setting the password

## Usage

Run the Launcher.bat and it will proceed to enter the password and 
tab into the authentication key field to be entered manually. Once the "play" button is pressed,
the game will open like normal and the program will execute to modify the size of the cursor.
Once the game is quit or closed, the program will set the cursor size back to default.
